[00:00-00:08] Welcome everyone to our sprint planning session. Our goal today is to plan the work for Sprint 24.

[00:08-00:20] Let's start by reviewing our sprint goal. We want to deliver the user profile management feature and complete the mobile responsive design for the main dashboard.

[00:20-00:35] Looking at our velocity from the last sprint, we completed 32 story points. Our average over the last three sprints has been around 30 points, so let's aim for 30-32 points this sprint.

[00:35-00:50] First story on the backlog is "User can edit profile information". This includes first name, last name, email, and phone number. Based on our technical design, this should be pretty straightforward. What do we think for sizing?

[00:50-01:05] I'd say it's a 5-pointer. We need to build the API endpoints, update the database schema, create the UI form, and add validation. Plus we need to handle profile photo upload which adds complexity.

[01:05-01:15] Agreed. Let's call it 5 points. Who wants to pick this up?

[01:15-01:22] I can take it. I've been working on the user module so this fits well with what I know.

[01:22-01:30] Great, assigned to John. Next story is "Users can change their password".

[01:30-01:45] This one should be simpler since we already have the password hashing infrastructure. We just need to add the change password endpoint and UI. I'd estimate 3 points.

[01:45-01:55] Sounds reasonable. Sarah, does this make sense for you since you're working on auth-related features?

[01:55-02:02] Yes, I'll take that one. 3 points works for me.

[02:02-02:15] Perfect. Now for the mobile responsive design stories. We have the dashboard, navigation, and settings pages that need to be made responsive.

[02:15-02:30] For the dashboard, we'll need to adjust the grid layout, make sure charts are readable on small screens, and optimize the data tables. This is probably an 8-pointer given the complexity.

[02:30-02:45] That seems high. Can we break it down into smaller pieces? Maybe separate the chart responsiveness from the table optimization?

[02:45-03:00] Good point. Let's split it into two stories: "Responsive dashboard layout and charts" for 5 points, and "Responsive data tables" for 3 points.

[03:00-03:10] Much better. Mike, can you handle the dashboard layout and charts?

[03:10-03:18] Sure, I've been working on the frontend so I'm familiar with the codebase.

[03:18-03:30] Excellent. So far we're at 16 points. Let's keep go ing and see what else we can fit in the sprint.

[03:30-03:45] Next is the navigation responsiveness. This includes the hamburger menu for mobile, collapsible sidebar, and touch-friendly navigation. Estimate?

[03:45-03:55] I'd say 5 points. There's quite a bit of work to make the navigation work well on both mobile and tablet.

[03:55-04:05] Agreed. Who's available for this?

[04:05-04:12] I can take it after I finish the password change story.

[04:12-04:25] Sounds good, Sarah. That brings us to 21 points. We have room for maybe 10-12 more points to hit our target.

[04:25-04:40] We have a few smaller bugfix tickets. There's the issue with session timeout not working correctly - that's been reported by multiple users. Should we prioritize that?

[04:40-04:55] Yes, definitely. Session management is critical for security. How complex is the fix?

[04:55-05:10] I've already investigated it. The issue is in our Redis configuration. The fix is straightforward but we need to test it thoroughly. I'd estimate 3 points for implementation and testing.

[05:10-05:18] Okay, let's add that. Who wants to own it?

[05:18-05:25] I'll take it. I set up the Redis infrastructure originally.

[05:25-05:35] Great, thanks Mike. We're at 24 points now. Any other critical items we should consider?

[05:35-05:50] There's the performance optimization for the search feature. Page load times have been slow when there are many results. It's not critical but it would be good to address.

[05:50-06:05] How big is that effort?

[06:05-06:20] It depends on whether we want to just add pagination or do deeper optimizations like caching and database indexing. With just pagination, maybe 3 points. With the full optimization, 8 points.

[06:20-06:35] Let's do the pagination for now as a 3-pointer. We can revisit the deeper optimizations next sprint if needed.

[06:35-06:42] I'll take that story.

[06:42-06:55] Perfect. So our final commitment is 27 story points, which is right in our comfort zone. Let's review the list one more time to make sure we're all aligned.

[06:55-07:15] We have: user profile editing for 5, password change for 3, responsive dashboard for 5, responsive tables for 3, responsive navigation for 5, session timeout fix for 3, and search pagination for 3. Total 27 points.

[07:15-07:25] Everyone comfortable with this plan?

[07:25-07:30] Yes, looks good to me.

[07:30-07:33] Same here, ready to start.

[07:33-07:40] Great. Let's make Sprint 24 a success. Meeting adjourned.
