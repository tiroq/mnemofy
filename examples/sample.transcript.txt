[00:00:00–00:00:15] Welcome everyone to today's product planning meeting. I'm glad we could all make it.
[00:00:15–00:00:32] Let's start by discussing our roadmap for Q2. We have several important features to prioritize.
[00:00:32–00:01:05] First on the agenda is the new dashboard redesign. Sarah, can you give us an update on the progress?
[00:01:05–00:01:28] Sure. The design team has completed the mockups and we're ready to move into development phase.
[00:01:28–00:01:55] Great. I think we should decide today whether to include the advanced analytics module in the first release.
[00:01:55–00:02:18] After reviewing the timeline, I believe we can include it if we allocate two additional developers.
[00:02:18–00:02:45] That makes sense. We've decided to go ahead with the analytics module in the initial release.
[00:02:45–00:03:10] Perfect. John, can you create the technical specification document by Friday?
[00:03:10–00:03:32] Absolutely, I'll have that ready. Should we schedule a follow-up next week to review it?
[00:03:32–00:03:55] Yes, let's plan for Tuesday at 2 PM. Any other concerns or questions about the project?
[00:03:55–00:04:20] One concern - we might face integration challenges with the legacy API. We should assess the risk.
[00:04:20–00:04:45] Good point. Let's have the engineering team evaluate that this week and report back.
[00:04:45–00:05:10] Alright, I think we've covered everything. Thanks everyone for the productive discussion.
