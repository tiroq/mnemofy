00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Welcome everyone to today's product planning meeting. I'm glad we could all make it.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's start by discussing our roadmap for Q2. We have several important features to prioritize.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:01:05,000
First on the agenda is the new dashboard redesign. Sarah, can you give us an update on the progress?

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Sure. The design team has completed the mockups and we're ready to move into development phase.

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Great. I think we should decide today whether to include the advanced analytics module in the first release.

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:18,000
After reviewing the timeline, I believe we can include it if we allocate two additional developers.

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That makes sense. We've decided to go ahead with the analytics module in the initial release.

8
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Perfect. John, can you create the technical specification document by Friday?

9
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Absolutely, I'll have that ready. Should we schedule a follow-up next week to review it?

10
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes, let's plan for Tuesday at 2 PM. Any other concerns or questions about the project?

11
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:20,000
One concern - we might face integration challenges with the legacy API. We should assess the risk.

12
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Good point. Let's have the engineering team evaluate that this week and report back.

13
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Alright, I think we've covered everything. Thanks everyone for the productive discussion.
